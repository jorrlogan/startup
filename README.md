# Shorelines - A Medical Tourism Solution

## Elevator Pitch
Millions of Americans don’t have dental or health insurance. Paying out of pocket for certain dental and health treatments is expensive. Many in this situation have found cheaper out of pocket healthcare outside of the US, in particular, Mexico. The lower costs of labor and loosened healthcare restrictions allow for cheaper healthcare. It’s my assumption that many Americans would like to travel to Mexico for healthcare but have little knowledge of how to do it safely. This business would partner with dental offices across the border in Tijuana, Mexicali, Molar City, and Monterey Mexico. It would be a secure and verified payment platform that would allow Americans to book dental procedures while enjoying the valuable rating system on the different available dental practices.
